
ARIA Installation Instructions
===============================
Version 2.7.1

Don't forget to sign up for the Aria-Users mailing list by sending a message

ARIA software development is supported on Windows 2000 using MS Visual 
C++ .NET 2003 (Version 7) and Visual C++ 2008 (Version 9), and on 
GNU/Linux using GNU development tools (make, GCC).

See README.txt for more information.


Windows:
--------

Run Aria-2.7.1.exe to invoke the setup program, then simply
follow the prompts.  All ARIA software will be installed in 
C:\Program Files\MobileRobots\Aria.  Shortcuts will be installed
in the Start menu to documentation, examples, and the Aria directory.

The kit includes the Aria library and two pre-built examples
that you can run from the bin directory. To see more examples, 
open Microsoft Visual Studio and load the example projects
(examples\All_Examples.sln).

In order to compile ARIA and the examples, you should use Microsoft 
Visual C++ .NET 2003 or Visual C++ Express 2008.  Use the "-vc2003.sln"
solution files if using VC 2003, and use the "-vc2008.sln" files
if using VC 2008.

We have discontinued support Visual C++ 6.0.  We only support Visual
C++ .net 2003 now.  We switched to Visual C++ .net since it was no
longer possible to obtain Visual C++ 6.0 and we are now discontinuing
support for Visual C++ 6.0.  The libraries compiled between the two
versions in our experience do not work either forwardly compatible or
backwardly compatible.  If you really want to use Visual C++ 6.0 the 
old files are in the vc++6 directory, see the README.txt in that directory, 
note that these files are unsupported.


GNU/Linux:
----------

To use the precompiled Aria library under Linux, you will need GCC 3.4 
(with the C++ compiler, g++) and Make.  The ARIA libraries and examples 
come built with GCC 3.4.  If you would like to rebuild them with a 
different compiler or version, run "make clean; make" from the top 
level /usr/local/Aria directory.  You can also set environment 
variables to affect compilation with make, such as CXX and CXXFLAGS. 
For example, if you want to use the command "g++-3.4" to compile, set
CXX to g++-3.4 and export the variable. See README.txt for more discussion
of this.

The ARIA and ArNetworking libraries and some pre-built examples are included.
You can run these examples and find more examples in the examples 
directory.  All ARIA software is placed in /usr/local/Aria.  In addition, 
the file /etc/Aria will be created with the ARIA installation location, 
and /etc/ld.so.conf may be updated to include /usr/local/Aria/lib. 



To install on RedHat:
---------------------

For RedHat, the ARIA and ArNetworking libraries are provided by the
"ARIA" RPM package, which provides libAria, libArNetworking, all 
documentation, source code, example programs, and Java and Python
wrapper libraries.

To install the ARIA RPM package, log in as the 'root' user, or use the
'su' command to become root. Then install with 'rpm':
   rpm -i ARIA-2.7.1-0.i386.rpm

Aria will be installed in /usr/local/Aria.

To upgrade an existing ARIA install use 'rpm -U' instead of 'rpm -i'.  
To remove  the currently installed Aria package, use:
   rpm -e ARIA
   
See the documentation for 'rpm' for more options:
   man rpm


To install on Debian:
---------------------

ARIA libraries are provided by the following Debian packages: libaria, 
libaria-python, libaria-java.  libaria provides libArNetworking as well 
as libAria, and all documentation, source code, and example programs.
libaria-python and libaria-java provide the Python and Java wrapper 
libraries respectively.

To install a .deb package file downloaded from the website, use dpkg:
   dpkg -i libaria_2.7.1_i386.deb

Aria will be installed in /usr/local/Aria.

You may also need to install dependencies using aptitude, synaptic, or 
apt-get.

To uninstall the ARIA libraries, use 'apt-get remove libaria'. Any
packages that depend on libaria will also be removed.


To install on other GNU/Linux systems:
--------------------------------------

Many Linux systems use either the RPM or DEB packaging formats, or
a tool such as "alien" can be used to convert.  Alternatively, you
may download the source code as a compressed 'tar' archive and 
compile Aria yourself (See README.txt for notes about compiling 
the source).

Unpack the .tar.gz archive:
   tar xzvf ARIA-2.7.1.tgz

Enter the new directory, and use make to build ARIA:
   cd Aria-2.7.1
   make

To install Aria, become the root user and use make again:
   su
   ...
   make install

Aria will be installed in /usr/local/Aria.   The dynamic (shared) 
libraries are in /usr/local/Aria/lib and the header files are in
/usr/local/Aria/include and /usr/local/Aria/ArNetworking/include.

Next, you will then need to tell the dynamic linker where to find the ARIA 
libraries: either add "/usr/local/Aria/lib" to /etc/ld.so.conf for 
permanent effect, or add it to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable 
for temporary effect.

All future development should use the installed Aria, not the source
you unpacked, so that directory may be removed.

The ARIA libraries depend require only the following standard Linux 
system libraries: libpthread, libdl 2, librt 1, libm 6, libc 6, libstdc++ 6.
So on most current systems you should not need to install anything 
extra to use ARIA.
