/**
 * A simple interface for measuring time intervals. An instance of this goes
 * through the following lifecycle states:
 * <DL>
 *  <DT> <EM>ready</EM>
 *      <DD> timer is ready to start a new measurement
 *  <DT> <EM>started</EM>
 *      <DD> timer has recorded the starting time interval point
 *  <DT> <EM>stopped</EM>
 *      <DD> timer has recorded the ending time interval point
 * </DL>
 * See individual methods for details.<P>
 * 
 * If this library has been compiled with {@link ITimerConstants#DO_STATE_CHECKS}
 * set to 'true' the implementation will enforce this lifecycle model and throw
 * IllegalStateException when it is violated.
